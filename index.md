# [ZDL NFT]

If you're reading this you've probably seen collections of collections of "uniquely generated collectibles". Collectibles are great, but the 7,777 ZDL tokens are here to simply enable anyone with access to the Ethereum blockchain to gain a financial asset that will contribute to disenfranchised communities, generate residual income from [bosiér](https://bosier.xyz) shares - which we'll get to soon - and drip with urgency and priority. Zero Day Loot is a global initiative. The ZDL tokens will be here February 2022!

Each token contains a unique token ID, protocol, concept, phrase, and rarity. Rarity details will be revealed by the end of January. All tokens merit a unique percent of bosiér sales revenue and a percentage off of all clothing. Each token image also contains a topographic backdrop design. Some tokens contain concepts and/or phrases in English and others are in French. **[[Discord]](https://discord.gg/H6WzSgyY) [[Twitter]](https://twitter.com/zerodayloot/)**

# [bosiér;](https://bosier.xyz)

bosiér reconciles inner-city life and a rapidly changing world of technology. It draws connection between the mutual influence amid at-risk Black youth and the algorithms that exist in the infrastructure and [social] media that rely on technology. Designs draw influence from many sources such as fine art, the growing globalism in urban youth culture and fashion, typography and design within software development. bosiér aims to artistically display these inspirations under the same light, via fashion and other mediums. bosiér is currenty a designer in its early stages. However, it is a lifelong namesake organization and most if not all non-fashion related business created by the bosiér creators will be subsidiary to bosiér thus increasing the value of each token.
